TRNG TEST SUITE is a suite of python scripts to compute the entropy rate of an oscillator
based TRNG.

It implements the algorithms described in the paper:
Entropy Computation in Oscillator Based Physical Random Number Generator

It is composed of the following python scripts:
simul.multiple_ratio.dirac.py
simul.multiple_ratio.py
simul.nxor.dirac.py
simul.nxor.py

and the following library:
source_mod_time.py
